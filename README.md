# Time-Counter

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of how the New Year countdown works using JavaScript:

**1.HTML Layout:**
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) with a basic structure.
Add a button to start the countdown.
Display the countdown timer for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

**2.JavaScript Logic:**
In your JavaScript file (e.g., script.js), calculate the time remaining until the new year.
Get the current date and time using new Date().
Set the target date (e.g., January 1) for the new year.
Calculate the time difference between the current time and the target time.
Convert the time difference to days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Update the HTML elements with the countdown values.

**3.Styling:**
You can style the countdown using CSS or Bootstrap classes.

**4.Preview:**
Open your HTML file in a web browser to see the countdown in action!
